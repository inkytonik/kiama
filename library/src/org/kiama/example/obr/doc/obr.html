    <h2>Obr Language Reference Manual</h2>

    Obr is a simple imperative language modelled on the Oberon family
    of languages designed by Niklaus Wirth.  
    This document provides background information needed to understand
    the semantics of the language.<p>

    The document has five subsections, each dealing with one aspect of
    the language: basic symbols, programs, declarations, statements,
    and expressions.  Basic symbols are the indivisible atoms of the
    language, and their meanings are defined by relating them to our
    shared experience with programming languages.  All other
    constructs are composite---each is formed by combining parts.
    Their meanings can thus be defined in terms of the meanings of
    their components and fundamental concepts such as ``sequence of
    execution.''

    <h3>Basic Symbols</h3>

    The basic symbols of Obr are its identifiers, denotations, and
    delimiters.  The following regular expressions describe the
    structure of identifiers and integers in Obr.

<pre>
Identifier: [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*
Integer: [0-9]+
</pre>

    Upper- and lower-case versions of the same letter are distinct.
    The delimiters and other denotations of the language are the
    following special characters and keywords:

<pre>
( ) : ; + - * = , := ~ # &lt; &gt; . [ ] .. |
AND ARRAY BEGIN BOOLEAN CONST DO ELSE ELSIF END EXIT FALSE FOR IF
INTEGER LOOP MOD OF OR PROGRAM RETURN THEN TO TRUE VAR WHILE 
</pre>

    An identifier is a freely chosen representation for an object.  It
    is given meaning by a construct of the program. The appearances at
    which an identifier is given a meaning are called <em>defining
    occurrences</em> of that identifier.  All other appearances of the
    identifier are called <em>applied occurrences</em>.<p>

    Denotations have the usual meanings.<p>

    Keywords can be used only as indicated by the context-free grammar 
    productions.<p>

    Comments are arbitrary sequences of characters beginning with
    ``(*'' and ending with ``*)''.  Comments cannot be nested.
    Comments, spaces, and newlines may not appear within basic
    symbols.  Two adjacent basic symbols must be separated by one or
    more comments, spaces, or newlines, unless one of the basic
    symbols is a special character.  Otherwise comments, spaces, and
    newlines are meaningless.

    <h3>Program Structure</h3>

<pre>
Program      : "PROGRAM" Identifier "(" ParameterDecl (";" ParameterDecl)* ")" ":" "INTEGER" ";"
               Declarations "BEGIN" StatementSeq "END" Identifier ".".
StatementSeq : Statement*.
</pre>

    A program specifies a computation by describing a sequence of
    actions.  A computation specified in Obr may be realized by any
    sequence of actions having the same effect as the one described
    here for the given computation.  The meaning of constructs that do
    not satisfy the rules given here is undefined. Whether, and in
    what manner, a particular implementation of Obr gives meaning to
    undefined constructs is outside the scope of this definition.<p>

      A program is executed by reading parameter values from the
      standard input and executing the component
      <em>StatementSeq</em>.  A Return statement must be executed to
      terminate the program.<p>

      The component statements of a statement sequence are executed in
      the sequence in which they were written.<p>

    <h4>Visibility rules</h4>

    Obr programs contain only one scope: the global scope.  Hence all
    identifiers must be declared as either parameters to the program
    or in the global declaration section.  Thus the visibility rules
    of Obr are very simple: every applied occurrence of an identifier
    must <em>identify</em> a defining occurrence of that identifier in
    the global scope.  It is illegal to have two defining occurrences
    of the same identifier, or an applied occurrence with no
    corresponding defining occurrence.<p>

      All of the occurrences of <em>Identifier</em> in the productions
      for <em>Program</em>, <em>ParameterDecl</em>,
      <em>ConstantDecl</em> and <em>VariableDecl</em> are defining
      occurrences, except the last occurrence in <em>Program</em>.
      All instances of <em>Identifier</em> in other productions are
      applied occurrences.<p>

      The last occurrence of <em>Identifier</em> in the
      <em>Program</em> production must identify the defining
      occurrence immediately after the "PROGRAM" keyword.

    <h3>Declarations</h3>

<pre>
ParameterDecl : Identifier ":" "INTEGER". 
Declarations  : ("CONST" (ConstantDecl ";")+)?
                ("VAR" (VariableDecl ";")+)?.
ConstantDecl  : Identifier "=" Integer.
VariableDecl  : Identifier ":" TypeSpec.
TypeSpec      : "INTEGER"
              | "BOOLEAN"
              | "ARRAY" Integer "OF" "INTEGER".
</pre>

    <h4>Values, Types, Objects, and Variables</h4>

    <em>Values</em> are abstract entities upon which operations may be
    performed, <em>types</em> classify values according to the
    operations that may be performed on them, and <em>objects</em> are
    the concrete instances of values that are operated upon.  Two
    objects are <em>equal</em> if they are instances of the same
    value. A <em>variable</em> of type <em>t</em> is a concrete
    instance of an abstract entity that can <em>refer to</em> (or
    <em>contain</em>) an object that is an instance of a value of type
    <em>t</em>.<p>

      Every object and variable has a specified <em>extent</em> during
      which it can be operated upon.  The extents of denotations are
      unbounded; the extents of constants and variables are determined
      by their declarations.<p>

      Values of type "INTEGER" have the usual meanings.  The range of
      integer values is determined by the particular implementation of
      Obr.<p>

      Values of type "BOOLEAN" represent truth values.  Only two
      Boolean values exist: true and false, denoted by the keywords
      "TRUE" and "FALSE", respectively.<p>
      
      Values of array type represent collections of a given number of
      integer elements.<p>

    <h4>Parameter Declarations</h4>

    A variable is created, and the identifier represents this
    variable. The extent of the created variable is the entire
    execution history of the program.  It refers initially to an
    object read from the standard input before program execution
    begins.  The objects read are referred to by the variables named
    in the parameter list in order from left to right.<p>

      If the parameter declaration has the form:

<pre>
<em>Identifier</em> : <em>t</em>
</pre>

    then the created variable can refer to objects of type <em>t</em>.

    <h4>Constant Declarations</h4>

    A constant is created, and the identifier represents this
    constant.  The extent of the created constant begins when the
    declaration is executed and ends when execution of the program is
    complete.<p>

      If the constant declaration has the form:

<pre>
<em>Identifier</em> = <em>integer</em>
</pre>

    then the created constant refers to an object whose value is that
    of the specified integer denotation.

    <h4>Variable Declarations</h4>

    A variable is created, and the identifier represents this
    variable. The extent of the created variable begins when the
    declaration is executed and ends when execution of the program is
    complete.<p>

      If the variable declaration has the form:

<pre>
<em>Identifier</em> : <em>t</em>
</pre>

    then the created variable can refer to objects of type <em>t</em>.
    Initially, it refers to an arbitrary object.

    <h3>Statements</h3>

<pre>
Statement   : Identifier ":=" Expression ";"
            | Identifier "[" Expression "]" ":=" Expression ";"
            | Conditional
            | Iteration
            | "EXIT" ";"
            | "RETURN" Expression ";".
Conditional : "IF" Expression "THEN" StatementSeq ("ELSE" StatementSeq)? "END".
Iteration   : "LOOP" StatementSeq "END"
            | "WHILE" Expression "DO" StatementSeq "END"
            | "FOR" Identifier ":=" Expression "TO" Expression "DO"
              StatementSeq "END".
</pre>

    <h4>Assignments</h4>

    An assignment statement causes the variable or array element represented
    by the identifier or subscripted identifier on the left to refer to a
    new instance of the value yielded by the expression on the right.
    The type of the expression must be the same as the type of the
    left-hand side.

    <h4>Conditionals</h4>

    Conditional statements specify the conditional execution of
    guarded statements.  The Boolean expression preceding a statement
    is called its <em>guard</em>.  The guards are evaluated in
    sequence of occurrence, until one evaluates to true, whence its
    associated statement sequence is executed.  If no guard is
    satisfied, the statement sequence following the symbol "ELSE" is
    executed, if there is one.

    <h4>Iterations</h4>

    A "LOOP" form of iteration repeatedly executes its component
    statement sequence.  The only way to exit a "LOOP" is using an
    exit statement or return statement.<p>

      An iteration of the form

<pre>
WHILE <em>e</em> DO <em>s</em> END
</pre>

    is identical in meaning to the iteration

<pre>
LOOP IF ~ <em>e</em> THEN EXIT END; <em>s</em> END
</pre>

    An iteration of the form

<pre>
FOR <em>id</em> := <em>e1</em> TO <em>e2</em> DO <em>s</em> END
</pre>

    requires that <em>id</em> be an integer variable, <em>e1</em> and
    <em>e2</em> be expressions yielding integer values, and the
    iteration is identical in meaning to the sequence of statements

<pre>
<em>id</em> := <em>e1</em>;
<em>limit</em> := <em>e2</em>;
LOOP
  IF <em>id</em> &gt; <em>limit</em> THEN EXIT END;
  <em>s</em>; 
  <em>id</em> := <em>id</em> + 1;
END;
</pre>
where <em>limit</em> is a compiler-generated temporary integer variable.

    <h4>Exit statements</h4>

    An exit statement may appear only within the component statement
    sequence of a "LOOP" iteration.  Execution of an exit statement
    causes termination of the smallest enclosing "LOOP" statement and
    continuation with the statement following that "LOOP" statement.

    <h4>Return</h4>

    A return statement is executed by first evaluating the component
    expression. Execution of the program is then terminated, with the
    value of the component expression as the result.  The type of the
    expression must be the same as the return type of the program
    (which is always "integer") or real in which case the real value
    is truncated before being returned.

    <h3>Expressions</h3>

    Expression structure in Obr is determined by operator precedence and
    associativity in the usual way:

<pre>
Expression : SimpleExp | Expression RelOp SimpleExp.
RelOp      : "=" | "#" | "<" | ">".
SimpleExp  : Term | SimpleExp AddOp Term.
AddOp      : "+" | "-" | "OR".
Term       : Factor | Term MulOp Factor.
MulOp      : "*" | "/" | "MOD" | "AND".
Factor     : Identifier | Integer |
           | Identifier "[" Expression "]" 
           | "TRUE" | "FALSE" | "(" Expression ")"
           | "~" Factor | "-" Factor.
</pre>

    Each subexpression (<em>SimpleExp</em>, <em>Term</em> and
    <em>Factor</em>) may be evaluated to yield an object of a certain
    type.  The operands of an expression may be evaluated in an
    arbitrary order unless the operator is "OR" or "AND" (see below).<p>

      The following table shows all Obr operators with their the
      operand type(s) and result type.

<pre>
     Op1      Op2      Result     Operation

=    integer   integer   Boolean     integer equality 
     Boolean   Boolean   Boolean     Boolean equality  
#    integer   integer   Boolean     integer inequality 
     Boolean   Boolean   Boolean     Boolean inequality  
&lt;    integer   integer   Boolean     integer less than  
&gt;    integer   integer   Boolean     integer greater than  
+    integer   integer   integer     integer addition  
-    integer   integer   integer     integer subtraction  
*    integer   integer   integer     integer multiplication  
/    integer   integer   integer     integer division  
MOD  integer   integer   integer     integer remainder  
OR   Boolean   Boolean   Boolean     disjunction   
AND  Boolean   Boolean   Boolean     conjunction   
-    integer             integer     integer negation  
~    Boolean             Boolean     Boolean complement  
</pre>

    Equality yields the value true if its operands have the same
    value.  Otherwise, it yields the value false.<p>

      The arithmetic operators addition, subtraction, multiplication,
      division, and remainder have the usual meaning as long as the
      values of all operands and results lie in the range permitted by
      the mapping from Obr objects to target machine objects.
      Division and remainder are defined only when the value of the
      right operand is nonzero.<p>

      The result of an integer division operation with dividend m and
      divisor n # 0 is determined as follows:

      <ol>
      <li>Let q and 0 &lt; r &lt; |n| be two integers such that
        m = q * n + r.
      <li>If r = 0 then the result of m / n is q.
      <li>Otherwise, if m &gt; 0 and n &gt; 0 then the result of 
        m / n is q. 
      <li>Otherwise, the result of m / n is either q or q+1
        at the discretion of the implementor.
    </ol>

    The result of the remainder operation m MOD n is given by:
    m - (m / n) * n.<p>

      The Boolean operators "OR" and "AND" are evaluated in a ``short
      circuit'' fashion.  That is, when evaluating "OR" if the left
      operand evaluates to true then evaluation of the "OR" returns
      true and the right operand is not evaluated.  Similarly, when
      evaluating "AND" if the left operand evaluates to false then
      evaluation of the "AND" returns false and the right operand is not
      evaluated.

    <h3>Sample Obr Programs</h3>

    The following is an Obr program to compute the greatest common
    divisor of two integers.  The initial values of the parameters are
    read from the standard input device as a part of the
    initialisation process.  The result returned by the program is
    written to the standard output device as a part of the
    finalisation process.

<pre>
PROGRAM GCD (x : INTEGER; y : INTEGER) : INTEGER;

BEGIN
    WHILE x # y DO
        IF x > y
            THEN x := x - y
            ELSE y := y - x
        END
    END;
    RETURN x
END GCD.
</pre>

    The factorial program below uses a constant declaration to define
    the limit imposed by machine arithmetic.  If the initial value of
    v is invalid, the program returns -1 as the answer.

<pre>
PROGRAM Factorial (v : INTEGER) : INTEGER;

CONST
    limit = 7;

VAR
    c : INTEGER;
    fact : INTEGER;

BEGIN
    IF (v < 0) OR (v > limit) THEN
        RETURN -1
    ELSE
        c := 0;
        fact := 1;
        WHILE c < v DO
            c := c + 1;
            fact := fact * c
        END;
        RETURN fact
    END
END Factorial.
</pre>
