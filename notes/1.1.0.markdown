### Enhancements
  * attribution:
    * parent-child connections in Attributable now work for any GenTraversable, not just Seqs
    * parent-child connection setting is now protected rather than private so it can be customised
  * machine:
    * new reset method
  * pretty printing:
    * new pretty printing combinator library based on Swierstra and Chitil, _Linear, bounded, functional pretty-printing_, Journal of Functional Programming, 19 (1), 2008. See FIXME for documentation.
    * use pretty printer in many examples
  * rewriting:
    * generic traversals now work on Rewritable, Product, Traversable and Map values
    * generic traversals now return the subject term if no changes are made to its children
    * new Rewritable trait for custom rewriting of any structure
  * general:
    * move to Scala 2.9.0, ScalaTest 1.4.1, ScalaCheck 1.9 and sbt 0.7.7
    * use org.scala-lang version of JLine

### Fixes
  * examples:
    * imperative: fix bug in unary minus tree construction
  * rewriting:
    * make more strategy parameters call-by-name
    * fix bugs in manybu and leaves combinators
    * remove unnecessary _where_ strategies based on one and some
  * testing:
    * many new tests to significantly improve code coverage
    * uniplate: constrain division by zero test to avoid heap exhaustion
