[Kiama](https://github.com/inkytonik/kiama) is a Scala library for language processing including attribute grammars, term rewriting, abstract state machines, parsing, and pretty printing.

This is a minor release that bumps versions for Scala and some libraries that have security issues.
Thanks to datYori for the security bumps.
