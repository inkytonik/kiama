[Kiama](https://github.com/inkytonik/kiama) is a Scala library for language processing including attribute grammars, term rewriting, abstract state machines and pretty printing.

This is a minor release to eliminate some unused code and a dependency.

### Removals

* Experimental and rarely-used support for profiling and tracing attribution and rewriting has been removed, because it was implemented using macros which won't work on Scala 3.

### Enhancements

* `Config`: Remove an unused runtime type tag that was needed by an earlier version of the Scallop library. This also removes our dependency on the `scala-reflect` library. (Contributed by @b-studios.)

### Other

* [Issue 6](https://github.com/inkytonik/kiama/issues/6): avoid partial function warnings in IntelliJ IDEA (aleksandr-vin).

* Move to scala 2.13.4, sbt 1.3.13.
