# Example: An Oberon0 compiler

IMPORTANT NOTE: This page describes Kiama 1.x. Much of it also applies
to Kiama 2.x, but not all. Please consult the 2.x release notes for the
main differences. We are currently writing comprehensive documentation
for 2.x that will eventually replace these pages.

A compiler for the Oberon-0 programming language defined in Niklaus
Wirth's book
[Compiler Construction](http://www.cs.inf.ethz.ch/~wirth/books/CompilerConstruction/).
This implementation was constructed as part of the
[Tool Challenge](http://ldta.info/2011/tool.html)
associated with the
[2011 Workshop on Language Descriptions, Tools and Applications](http://ldta.info/2011/index.html).

The example makes extensive use of attribution, pretty printing and rewriting.
It also uses Scala's traits and mixin facility to define components of the
compiler and assemble them to create the challenge artefacts.
